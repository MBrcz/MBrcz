- 👋 Hi, I’m @MBrcz
- 👀 I’m interested in Power Bi (DAX) / Excel (not-VBA) / Pandas && bs4 (Python) coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Power BI / Excel / Python. Becouse in those sectors you learn your whole live, don't you? But mostly focusing on BI right now.

Did you know that introduced in 2021 Excel function Let allows you to "code" almost just like in normal programming languages?
  Now instead of typing like normal, sane person:
  "= if(foo, bar, avc)"
  you can type:
  "= let(
        var1, foo,
        var2, bar,
        var3, avc,

        return, if(var1, var2, var3),
        return
      )"
      
  It might be handy in case of some advanced formulas.
